Customize from Protractor 

For Contributors
----------------
Clone the github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git
    cd protractor
    npm install

Start up a selenium server. By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.

Protractor's test suite runs against the included test application. Start that up with

    npm start

Then run the tests with

    npm test
